          Embarking on my JavaScript journey from the vibrant city of
          Yamunanagar to the dynamic tech hub of Gurugram, I bring over two
          years of industry wisdom as an experienced JavaScript Developer. My
          code tells storiesâ€”from the elegant dance of Angular to the rapid pace
          of Express and the lively rhythm of React. I've woven applications,
          threading through the language's basics to the intricate tapestries of
          Angular and React. My quest led me through the startup hustle and the
          corporate corridors of TCS.

      My journey officially began at Tata Consultancy Services, where I
      fine-tuned my skills in Angular, Typescript and HTML, working in an Agile
      environment. Collaborating with teammates, I developed the confidence to
      venture into new horizons.

      React to Express, SQL, and MongoDB. I thrive in fast-paced environments,
      relishing every challenge as an opportunity to unite with my team and
      craft innovative solutions.
